# Documentation Inbox

This is a **temporary holding area** for documentation that hasn't been categorized yet.

## Purpose

The inbox serves as a safe place to dump documentation quickly without worrying about immediate organization. However, **this directory should be kept empty** - documents here need to be reviewed and moved to their proper locations as soon as possible.

## How to Organize Documents

Follow this checklist for each document in the inbox:

1. **Read the document** - Understand its purpose and content
2. **Determine document type** - Use the decision tree in `/WARP.md` (Documentation Organization section)
3. **Move to proper directory**:
   - Guide/Tutorial → `../guides/features/` (or `ai-development/`, `testing/`)
   - Architecture/Design → `../architecture/`
   - Implementation Plan → `../implementation/planned/`
   - Active TODO → `../implementation/active/`
   - API Documentation → `../api/`
   - Troubleshooting/Debug → `../troubleshooting/`
   - Lesson Learned/ADR → `../decisions/`
   - Reference/Spec → `../reference/`
   - Completion Report → `../completed/features/` or `../completed/implementations/`
   - Session Summary → `../completed/sessions/`
4. **Update navigation** - Add entry to the target directory's README.md
5. **Update main docs README** - If it's a key document, add to `../README.md`

## Decision Tree Reference
