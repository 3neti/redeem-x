fix(kyc): resolve enum comparison bug preventing KYC badge display on Finalize page

Problem:
The 'Identity Verified' badge was not appearing in captured items on the Finalize page after successful KYC completion, despite Contact having approved KYC status.

Root Cause:
The RedeemController::finalize() method was comparing the string 'kyc' against VoucherInputField enum INSTANCES instead of their string VALUES. This caused in_array() to return false because PHP strict comparison failed between string and object types.

Solution:
Map enum instances to their string values before comparison using array_map() to extract the value property from each enum instance.

Changes Made:
1. RedeemController.php:
   - Added array_map() to convert enum instances to string values
   - Added comprehensive debug logging for KYC required check
   - Now correctly detects KYC input field in voucher instructions

2. Finalize.vue:
   - Added KYC to capturedItems computed property
   - Shows 'Identity Verified' badge when props.kyc.completed === true
   - Badge appears alongside Location, Selfie, and Signature

Impact:
- KYC badge now displays correctly after auto-approval
- Users can see KYC verification status on Finalize page
- No breaking changes to existing flows
- All enum-based input fields now correctly detected

Testing:
- Voucher BX6Z with KYC input enabled
- Complete redemption flow: Wallet -> Location -> Selfie -> Signature -> KYC -> Finalize
- KYC auto-approved via HyperVerge callback
- Verified 'Identity Verified' badge appears in captured items section

Technical Details:
- Enum comparison issue: PHP strict type checking failed on object vs string
- Session data correctly stored and retrieved throughout flow
- Contact KYC status persisted correctly in database
- Inertia props now properly pass KYC data to frontend

- Took 105k tokens to debug and fix (enum comparison not immediately obvious)
- No impact on existing vouchers without KYC input
